-Source order, inheritance, specificity, !important


What does the term "source order" mean with respect to CSS?
-Order that your CSS rules are written in your stylesheet.


How is it possible for the styles of an element to be applied to its children as well without an additional CSS rule?
-Inheritance is the process by which certain CSS properties on a child HTML element can receive value from a parent element

-element, class, id


Why is using !important considered bad practice?
-!important makes debugging more difficult by breaking the natural cascading in your stylesheets
