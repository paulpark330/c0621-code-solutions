How are linked lists different from an array?
-Linked lists are sequential access (like a queue), not random access (like an array).


How would you access an arbitrary node in a linked list (not just the "head")?
-In order to go to a specific place in the list, you have to start at the beginning, then jump from node to node until you get there.
